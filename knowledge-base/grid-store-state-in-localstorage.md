## Description

I want to preserve the Grid state between page reloads.

## Solution

You can achieve this by saving the DataState to the localStorage. In the onDataStateChange event handler, you can save the Grid state to the localStorage, and when the component loads, you can get the state and pass it as an initial state to the Grid.

{% meta id:index height:760 %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-save-datastate-to-localstorage/main.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file shared/products.json %}
{% endmeta %}
