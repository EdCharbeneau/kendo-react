## Description
I want to change the default editor for the TreeList with one that supports maxLength

## Solution
The TreeList columns have editCell that accepts not only the default editors that are provided in the package, but also a custom component. The following example shows how to define custom editor with input element where the maxLength attribute is set for limiting the number of characters:

{% meta id height:760 %}
{% embed_file treelist/treelist-custom-editor/main.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file treelist/treelist-custom-editor/data.js preview %}
{% embed_file treelist/treelist-custom-editor/my-command-cell.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file treelist/treelist-custom-editor/MyCustomTreeListTextEditor.js preview %}
{% endmeta %}
