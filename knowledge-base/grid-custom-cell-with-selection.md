## Environment

<table>

## Description
The row and cell selection stops to work If I define custom cell for a column. 

## Solution
Add the selected class name to the custom cell conditionally based on the "props.isSelected" value. The custom cell should also include the necessary attributes.

Following is an example demonstrating how to keep the Grid selection functionality with custom cell:

{% meta height:480 %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-custom-cell-with-selection/main.jsx preview %}
{% endmeta %}
