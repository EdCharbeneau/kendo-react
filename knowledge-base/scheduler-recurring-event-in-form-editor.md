## Description
I want to add a recurring event field in the custom form editor of the Scheduler component.

## Solution
You can add recurring events to a custom form editor by referencing the `recurrenceEditor`. The main idea is to import the `SchedulerFormEditor` from the `@progress/kendo-react-scheduler` package, add a Field in your custom form, and reference the `recurrenceEditor` that is now available via props using the component prop.

In the following example, when you double-click a recurring item, a Window component appears asking if you want to edit the current occurrence or the whole series

{% meta id:index height:760 %}
{% embed_file scheduler/recurring-event-form-editor/main.jsx preview%}
{% embed_file scheduler/recurring-event-form-editor/custom-form-editor.jsx %}
{% embed_file scheduler/recurring-event-form-editor/custom-dialog.jsx %}
{% embed_file scheduler/recurring-event-form-editor/custom-form.jsx %}
{% embed_file scheduler/recurring-event-form-editor/custom-item.jsx %}
{% embed_file scheduler/recurring-event-form-editor/editor.jsx %}
{% embed_file scheduler/recurring-event-form-editor/data.js %}
{% endmeta %}
