## Environment
<table>

	    	<td>5.13.1</td>
	    </tr>

## Description
I want the popup of the ComboBox to open when the component is initialized 


## Solution
For manually opening the popup of the ComboBox after the initialization we can use its "ref" within React.useEffect and use "toggleBtnClick" to simulate a click and trigger the opening.

Here is an example demonstrating this approach:

{% meta id height:480 %}
{% embed_file dropdowns/combobox-open-popup-initially/app.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file dropdowns/combobox-open-popup-initially/main.jsx %}
{% endmeta %}
