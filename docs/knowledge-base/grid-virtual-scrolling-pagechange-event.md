## Environment

<table>
    <tbody>
	    <tr>
	    	<td>Product Version</td>
	    	<td>5.9.0</td>
	    </tr>

    </tbody>

## Description

When virtual scrolling is enabled for the Grid, the onPageChange event fires even if the horizontal scrollbar is moved. How can I determine if the onPageChange is triggered from the vertical scrollbar?

## Solution

The onPageChange event contains the nativeEvent and storing its target scrollTop and scrollLeft values can be used for determining which scrollbar have triggered the event.

Following is an example demonstrating this approach:


{% meta id height:500 %}
{% embed_file grid/virtual-scrolling-pagechange-event/main.jsx preview %}
{% endmeta %}
