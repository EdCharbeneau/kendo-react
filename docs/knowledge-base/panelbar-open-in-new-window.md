## Environment

<table>

		<tr>
			<td>Product Version</td>
			<td>5.13.0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Product</td>
			<td>ProgressÂ® KendoReact</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

## Description
I want to have the option to open on right-click the PanelBarItem target in new window

## Solution
The browser displays the "Open in new window" option on right-click when the element has "href", so in order to allow this for the PanelBarItem we need to add an anchor element with "href". This can be achieved by setting a custom "title" for the PanelBarItem that will render the anchor element.
