## Description
When enabling selection for the Grid using the [selectable](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/grid/api/GridProps/#toc-selectable/) prop, scrolling does not work using mobile. This is because screen scrolling will trigger the selection. 


## Solution
Use checkbox selection instead. You can enable checkbox selection only when the Grid is used in a mobile machine. This will allow using the built-in `selectable` property when using a desktop or laptop, and only checkbox selection with a mobile machine.

Here is an example with the described approach, where we are importing the `useDeviceType` method from the `isMobile.jsx` file. This method is used when setting the `selectable` property of the Grid such that it is set to `null` when the device type is either a mobile or tablet. This leaves us with only the checkbox selection:

{% meta id height:550 %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-selection-mobile-scrolling/main.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-selection-mobile-scrolling/isMobile.jsx %}
{% embed_file shared/products.json %}
{% endmeta %}
