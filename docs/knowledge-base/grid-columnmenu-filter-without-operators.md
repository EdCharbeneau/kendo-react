## Description
 
I want to display columnMenu in the Grid columns without the DropDown for changing the operators. Can I achieve this without a custom filter and re-use the filter input?

## Solution 

Wrap the GridColumnMenuFilter in a DIV element with specific className and use that class name as a selector to hide all elements within the DIV with ".k-dropdownlist" class.

Following is an example demonstrating this approach

{% meta id:index height:360 %} 
{% embed_file grid/grid-columnmenu-filter-without-operators/app.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-columnmenu-filter-without-operators/main.jsx %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-columnmenu-filter-without-operators/columnMenu.jsx %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-columnmenu-filter-without-operators/styles.css.jsx %}
{% endmeta %}
