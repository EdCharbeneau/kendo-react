## Environment
<table>

## Description
I want to enable the scrollable functionality of the Grid if page size is higher than 10

## Solution
This can be achieved by setting the scrollable property of the Grid from a state variable and update its value based on the current page size (either within the onPageChange or within the onDataStateChange event)

This is an example showcasing this approach:

{% meta id:index height:540 %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-conditional-scrollbar/app.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-conditional-scrollbar/main.jsx %}
{% embed_file grid/grid-conditional-scrollbar/products.json %} 
{% endmeta %}
