## Description

How can I add a DropDownList for the operators in a custom filterCell?

## Solution

The GridFilterCellProps passed to the filterCell contain a collection with all operators (props.operators) that can be added to the "data" of the DropDownList. If there is a filter expression for the column, the selected operator is available within props.operator.

Following is an example demonstrating how to add a DropDownList for the operators in a filterCell:

{% meta id:index height:520 %}
{% embed_file grid/add-operators-dropdown-for-custom-filtercell/app.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file grid/add-operators-dropdown-for-custom-filtercell/main.jsx %}
{% embed_file grid/add-operators-dropdown-for-custom-filtercell/InputFilterCell.jsx %}
{% embed_file grid/add-operators-dropdown-for-custom-filtercell/sample-products.jsx %}
{% endmeta %}
