## Description  

How can I disable duplicate grouping for the Data Grid?

## Solution

In the `onGroupChange` event handler, you can check if the newly added group exists in the `group` state variable. In addition, when the group is added, `event.nativeEvent` is undefined. Since the `onGroupChange` event is also responsible to remove groups (in that case `event.nativeEvent` is defined), therefore, set the `group` and `resultState` only when `event.nativeEvent` is defined and `groupExists` equals false.

This is an example demonstrating the implementation:

{% meta id:index height:680 %}
{% embed_file grid/unique-groups/app.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file grid/unique-groups/main.jsx %}
{% embed_file shared/shared-products.json %}
{% endmeta %}
