## Description

Can I show custom text or icon in the Upload instead of the "Select files..." text?

## Solution

Set custom content for the select button through the "selectMessageUI" and place the custom text or the icon.

This is an example showcasing this:

{% meta id:index height:360 %}
{% embed_file upload/upload-icon-for-upload-button/app.jsx preview %}
{% embed_file upload/upload-icon-for-upload-button/main.jsx %}
{% endmeta %}
