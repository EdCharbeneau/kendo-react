## Description
I want the value of the Input to change only after the user stops typing for some time.

## Solution
Having a delayed value is possible by introducing a second state variable and tracking the time for the last change. Such implementation might be suitable for filtering, where triggering the filtering can be initiated only when the user stops typing.

This is an example showcasing how to limit the value:

{% meta height:300 %}
{% embed_file inputs/inputs-delayed-value-change/app.jsx preview %} 
{% embed_file inputs/inputs-delayed-value-change/main.jsx %} 
{% endmeta %}
