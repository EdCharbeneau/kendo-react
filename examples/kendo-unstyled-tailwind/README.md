# Using KendoReact components in Unstyled mode and TailwindCSS

## The scenario
The client already works with TailwindCSS to style their application and wants to include our KendoReact components in their project. They want to continue using the same styling technique with Tailwind without the need to add KendoTheme.

## The solution
We can use KendoReact components in Unstyled mode and use Tailwind classes to style the components as it is done in the sample `tailwind-preset.ts` file.

## Kendo Unstyled preset
The preset file is a sample set of classes for each KendoReact unstyled component that provides one possible way to have it styled. It can be further customized according to the design needs. 

## Getting started

1. npm i
2. npm start
